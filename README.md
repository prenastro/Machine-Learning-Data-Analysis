Trying to classify various night sky scenes and detect if there is an aurora in the sky, is it cloudy or otherwise. Hence it is a 3-class classification problem. 
The data is features extracted from all-sky camera images. 
The Classification Algorithms used are SVM, kNN and Naive Bayes.
Word document contains the code for the same and analysis results.
